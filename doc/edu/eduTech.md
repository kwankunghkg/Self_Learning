• Pilot new solutions, localise and scale their adoption in Hong Kong and the GBA  
• Set up a new “learning innovation hub” to connect, coordinate and facilitate different parties in implementing various initiatives, similar to the Helsinki Education Hub  
  
  
page 15  
EdTech refers to the applications of technology to make teaching and learning more effective and inclusive, such as mobile technology, immersive technologies, AI, big data, IoT and robotics. In the last few months, there has been a lot of  
attention on what the metaverse (web 4.0 platforms with immersive, blockchain and other technologies) means and how it will change the future of education.  
  
  
page 16  
EdTech as a terminology has been misunderstood by many investors. K12 has been receiving too much attention among the field, while adult / workforce development may mean more opportunities.  
  
  
page 17  
1.10 It should be emphasised that EdTech is relevant to a whole spectrum of learning, from early childhood education to workforce development and lifelong learning. ... This report has adopted learning innovation as the taxonomy.  
1.11 The pandemic has made digital transformation a necessity. Digital reskilling and upskilling should be high on the agenda of every business and society. And blended learning is fast becoming a new normal for schools and organisations alike. EdTech should be integral to and no less important than FinTech, Biotech, Art Tech and other initiatives to promote the innovation of various industries, and to ensure the overall competitiveness and sustainable development of every society.

• Migrating to lifelong learning business with higher education, work and lifelong learning becoming increasingly interconnected and integrated  
2.10 metaverse   
Stanford University has recently introduced the first fully VR course16 and it might open the door for more classes of its kind at Stanford and elsewhere.

2.13 The Mainland government has a strategic plan to build Asia’s Silicon Valley out of a cluster of 11 massive, hyper-connected cities in southern China, known as the Guangdong- Hong Kong - Macau Greater Bay Area.   
b. Beyond Mainland  
III. Chinese EdTech Going Out  
IV. East Asia Market  
South Korea is an early adopter of technologies in Asia with a strong focus on STEM education and a high receptiveness to international education. Facing an aging population and a shrinking workforce, the Japanese government has been reforming its education system focusing on English language education, computer science, internationalisation of its higher education systems and the promotion of active learning and new assessment mechanisms.   
  
  
page 24  
2.22 Hong Kong Education City, a government funded organisation, is one of the few educational organisations that seek to “promote the use of information technology (I.T.) to boost the effectiveness of learning and teaching“ with an emphasis on eLearning resources.   
  
  
page 26  
International schools in Hong Kong are more advanced in EdTech applications. Financial resources should not be a major concern, but more an issue of mindset and knowledge.  
Hong Kong companies are not keen on developing their own talents.  
  
  
page 29  
3.3   
According to an UNESCO policy paper, an effective, system-wide change strategy requires the following elements:  
• a focus on key strategies while also managing other  
interests and issues  
• a small number of publicly stated, inclusive, ambitious yet  
achievable and well-grounded goals  
• an emphasis on capacity building and a focus on results  
• continuous learning with innovative ways  
• importance of research and data  
• effective use of resources  
• strong implementation and follow-through in the change process  
• multi-level engagement with strong leadership and a “guiding coalition”

Being able to deal with a global and international economy is important. The goal is to be competitive in a global marketplace through learning and innovation.

By connecting education and learning innovators  
on a goal-oriented and systematic manner,  
new business and growth entrepreneurship is enhanced  
for creating new services and products.  
- Helsinki Education Hub -  
We need a more conducive macro environment with a clear policy, vision, strategy, plan and goals.  
  
  
page 32  
The government has been promoting STEM education in a big way. It is time to embrace EdTech as well.  
• to nurture future-ready generations  
• to upskill and reskill the current workforce  
• to promote trade and investment in EdTech  
• to develop Hong Kong as an learning innovation hub in the Greater Bay Area

School leadership is vital to build learning organisations and drive learning innovations and EdTech applications. Principal training is essential.  
4.10 Building a culture of learning innovation often begins with taking small and experimental steps.  
set up dedicated incubators for EdTech ventures to enable:  
• more co-creation amongst startups, educators and talent development professionals to identify the  
real user needs  
• rapid prototyping and pilots of potential solutions  
• channelling of resources of foundations and investors interested in learning innovations  
• more science of learning based research support to EdTech startups  
d.   
Sharing of Best Practices  
4.11 Peer learning is the most effective in driving new practices.   
e.   
Government Leading by Example (As the largest employer)  
  
  
page 35  
f. Empowering Students with One-to-One Computing  
The Japanese Government, for example, announced last year a US $4.4 billion GIGA programme to digitize education among the country’s nearly 13 million primary and secondary school students with one computer per student in its 35,000 schools.  
g. Media as Educator

c. EdTech Certification Schemes  
  
  
page 37  
I would expect a network where I can  
meet like-minded investors and share intelligence.  
  
  
page 38  
Experienced educators often face difficulties in adapting to new technologies.   
Junior teachers are more digitally-prepared but they cannot utilize digital tools to their full potential due to the lack of teaching experience.  
4.29 Fund Blended Learning Coordinator:   
Teachers do not have the incentive nor the time to learn EdTech applications. There should be teachers with designated roles.  
4.30 Encourage pilots and adoptions of EdTech:   
4.31 Make online and hybrid learning reimbursable:   
4.32 Support ecosystem development:   
  
  
page 40  
Overseas EdTech markets such as the US are much more mature.  
Hong Kong investors can learn a lot through co-investing  
with experienced EdTech investors.

4.41 Esperanza introduced the Edventures GBA Fellowship in 2020. (www.edventuresgba.com) to identify and support the introduction of innovative learning solutions to Hong Kong and Asia.   
4.43 On a national level, Zhongguancun Education (Z-Edu) can be one of the strategic partners in developing Hong Kong as a platform for Mainland EdTech ventures expanding overseas. Founded in 2014, Z-Edu is China’s first EdTech accelerator.  
4.45 In Finland, the City Mayor of Helsinki plays such a role with the establishment of the Helsinki Education Hub44. Run jointly with the University of Helsinki, the Hub is the first of its kind internationally. The objective behind the Helsinki Education Hub is to bring EdTech innovators, startups, investors, incubator, accelerator, learners, teachers, pedagogical experts, researchers, corporations and public organizations together under one roof physically and virtually.   
  
  
page 42  
4.46 Currently there is no single organisation in Hong Kong that has a dedicated mandate to promote and support EdTech development with all stakeholders in Hong Kong.   
Bringing together multiple sectors would demonstrate the versatility of EdTech and should be the major direction going forward.  
  
  
page 43  
Hong Kong needs a “Big, Hairy, Audacious Goal (BHGA)” to inspire and energise everyone in the society to future proof ourselves. Becoming a learning innovation and technology hub in the GBA is a means to developing a sustainable future for the city and creating a better life for our citizens. Esperanza is grateful for all the valuable feedback and inputs to the report. We look forward to working with visionary organisations and funders to spearhead a learning innovation movement in Hong Kong.
